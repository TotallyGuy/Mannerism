## What is Mannerism

Mannerism is an approach based RPG. You describe your character's actions with a little bit of roleplaying, thus demonstrating one of the game's 5 Manners. This is all that is needed to resolve your action and determine whether you have succeeded or failed.

Your character advances over time getting better at things as you do them. You have a lot of control over how you grow and change.
