## Conflicts: Tests and Confrontations

#### Conflicts

A conflict occurs when the player and GM disagree with what should happen next in accordance with the player character's capabilities.
A test is always against the world or environment. A confrontation is against another character or monster.
A conflict requires two parts. An intention and a task.
The intention is what you hope to achieve.
The task is how you will make it happen.

The GM verifies that one follows from the other to continue the conflict. Otherwise the GM can suggest an alternative task to achieve the intention or a new intention that follows from the player character's task. Go back and forth until a conflict is established or one is no longer needed.

The GM states which skill or spell is being used and whether the conflict is a Test or a Confrontation.

#### Tests

A test is against the environment. The GM declares a difficulty number from 1 to 8, 1 being easy and 8 being very hard and privately thinks of a complication taking inspiration from one of the following themes: Hostility, Time, Collateral, Consumption or Confusion. These can be abstract and can take the form of a success with a cost.

The player then selects their character's manner and describes their character's actions in line with it.

Characters with at least a rating of one in the relevant Skill can help in Conflicts.
Help provides a +1 bonus, but the helper will be included in the failure consequence should their friend fail.

#### Confrontation
 
A confrontation is against another character, one controlled by the GM or another player. If a player feels like the Confrontation stake is too high, they may leave the scene (or have the other character removed from the scene). This may only be prevented by the other player opting for a Confrontation with "keep them there" as their sole Intention against the party that tries to leave. A further Confrontation can follow when a party is unable to just leave.

#### Resolution

To see who has won we compare cards or check the relevant table to see how the Manner interacts. If the outcome is “Win”, then the player succeeds their Task, and their Intention comes to pass. If the outcome is “Lose”, then the player fails their Task and loses their Intention, the GM gets to involve their Environmental Complication or has the opponent’s Intention come to pass. In any other outcome we compare numbers.

#### Test Resolution Table
|GM Complication|Time |Confusion |Collateral |Hostility |Consumption |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Determination**|+0 |+0 Partial |Lose |Win |+2 |
|**Force**|+2 |+0 |+0 Partial |Lose |Win |
|**Speed**|Win |+2 |+0 |+0, Partial |Lose |
|**Precision**|Lose |Win |+2 |+0 |+0, Partial |
|**Imagination**|+0, Partial |Lose |Win |+2 |+0 |


#### Confrontation Resolution Table
|Opponent |Determination |Force |Speed |Precision |Imagination |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Determination**|+0 |+2 |Win |Lose |+0 Partial |
|**Force**|+0 Partial |+0 |+2 |Win |Lose |
|**Speed**|Lose |+0 Partial |+0 |+2 |Win |
|**Precision**|Win |Lose |+0 Partial |+0 |+2 |
|**Imagination**|+2 |Win |Lose |+0 Partial |+0 |

Add the rating of the Manner, Skill, any help and, if the table allows it, +2. The opponent or GM's complication does the same. The higher number wins.

If you win with “+0, Partial” you have a partial success. You succeed but the Opponent gets some small part of their Intention, or the GM gets to involve their complication in a minor way.

#### Ties

In the event of a tie, check the Manner or Skill for a Trait or Speciality, the tie is broken in favour of the side with the largest number of applicable descriptors. For a tie that is not broken, each side achieves a partial success, a compromised version of each side’s desired outcome.

## Advancement

After a Conflict you mark experience for the Manner and Skill combination.

#### Advancement Table
|Advancement |Social |Movement |Academics |Agility |Craft |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Determination**| | | | | |
|**Force**| | | | | |
|**Speed**| | | | | |
|**Precision**| | | | | |
|**Imagination**| | | | | |

When you have marked a whole row or column, erase the markings, and advance the Manner or Skill by 1.

If you complete two lines at once, advance them both, Manner and Skill.

Nothing can advance beyond 4. Keep the boxes marked.

## Traits and Specialities

Traits and Specialities can be used in combination with one another. When both a trait and a speciality are applicable, do not add the Manner and Skill together, instead use the higher number twice and ignore the lower one.

When you advance a Manner or Skill associated with a Trait or Speciality you get to mark the Trait or Speciality for advancement.

When all your Traits are marked for advancement, you get a new Trait or get to change an existing one. Then erase the advancement markers.

When all your Specialities are marked for advancement, you get a new Speciality or get to change an existing one. Erase the advancement markers.

The group discusses how the character has been played. Together decide on the descriptor and put it against a suitable ability. Traits and Specialities can also be applied to magical abilities from the next section.

If a Manner, Skill or Spell is rated 4 then keep the associated Trait or Speciality advancement box marked.

## Magic

Characters may have a gift for magic. Some have no gift. Some have a gift in a single manner. Some have a gift in all 5 manners. How this is managed is setting specific. A character may have or acquire a magical trait that describes their magic.

Using magic is like a normal Conflict but with a Spell in place of a Skill.

In a magical test the GM complications are: Backfire, Unleashed, Madness, Hunted and Dissipation.

#### Magical Test Resolution Table
||Backfire |Unleashed |Madness |Hunted |Dissipation |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Determination**|+0 |+0 Partial |Lose |Win |+2 |
|**Force**|+2 |+0 |+0 Partial |Lose |Win |
|**Speed**|Win |+2 |+0 |+0, Partial |Lose |
|**Precision**|Lose |Win |+2 |+0 |+0, Partial |
|**Imagination**|+0, Partial |Lose |Win |+2 |+0 |

Magical Traits and Specialities may be used to channel powers outside the scope of the five spells.

You have a second advancement table for magical conflicts.

#### Advancement Table
|Advancement |Illusion |Transformation |Enchantment |Evocation |Divination |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Determination**| | | | | |
|**Force**| | | | | |
|**Speed**| | | | | |
|**Precision**| | | | | |
|**Imagination**| | | | | |

## Killing and Injury

When intention is set to injure or kill, or a GM's test complication is to injure, a wound is generated by the margin of success.  A confrontation "win" result is considered to have a margin of success of 5 or whatever level of injury is given by the intention. A GM Test "win" result is the same as the "+2" result. 

The injured party marks one wound track's boxes with the number given by the margin. 

|Margin of Success |Wound |Effect |Recovery Difficulty |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
|1 | Superficial effect | No penalty, it just hurts. |1 |
|2 | Minor effect |If you get a “Win” result in a Conflict, instead treat this as a “+2” result. Opponent’s “Lose” treated as “+0, Partial”. |2 |
|3 | Serious effect |Your Skills and Spells all suffer -1. Those reduced to less than 0 cannot be used until recovered. |3 |
|4 | Traumatic effect |Your Manners all suffer -1. Any Manner reduced to -1 cannot be used. If any Manner is reduced to -2 you die instantly. |4 |
|5+ | Mortal wound |You can undertake one final Conflict within the current scene with no other penalties, but you die afterwards. |5 |

Wound effects are cumulative as more wound tracks are filled.

You may upgrade a wound to a mortal wound at will. 

#### Recovery

During your downtime you may attempt to recover from your wounds, or an ally may try to treat you. The Intention will be for recovery, but the Task is up to the player and verified by the GM. The difficulty is given by the most severe effect you are suffering.

Success recovers you from the most severe effect of each of your wound tracks.

Failure recovers you from the least severe effect of each of your wound tracks and involves the GM’s complication.

You may only attempt to recover from, or be treated for, injuries once for each instance of downtime.

Following a Mortal Wound, only if you can immediately enter downtime will you have an opportunity to be treated for it. To survive, this must succeed.

#### Armour

A piece of armour's quality is rated from 1 to 5 and protects one wound track. Mark the wound track with a shield symbol in the box that matches the quality. For example quality 4 marks the Traumatic effect level.

When you are hit and choose an armoured wound track deduct 1 from the number of boxes you mark and mark the shielded symbol last.

Wearing armour lowers your potential to cast Spells. A spell's maximum rating (4) is reduced by the rating of the highest quality armour piece you wear.

## Bestiary

All traits on monsters can be considered magical traits, these are the only way monsters may cast spells.
