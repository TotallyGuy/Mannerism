## What is Mannerism

Mannerism is an approach based RPG. You describe your character's actions with a little bit of roleplaying, thus demonstrating one of the game's 5 Manners. This is all that is needed to resolve your action and determine whether you have succeeded or failed.

It is a diceless game with the uncertainty coming entirely from the unpredictability of the other players.

Your character advances over time getting better at things as you do them. You have a lot of control over how you grow and change.

It reinforces a theme of personal barriers and secrecy. Do you keep yourself a secret and never let in love and friendship or do you let yourself be open to these things but make  yourself vulnerable to exploitation and a tragic destiny.

The full game comes with a setting a situation. You are miner/librarians with the potential to learn magic in a world of fearful sorcerers. This SRD is just the game system rules in a most practical, basic form.
