## Magic

Characters may have a gift for magic. Some have no gift. Some have a gift in a single manner. Some have a gift in all 5 manners. How this is managed is setting specific. A character may have or acquire a magical trait that describes their magic.

Using magic is like a normal Conflict but with a Spell in place of a Skill.

In a magical test the GM complications are: Backfire, Unleashed, Madness, Hunted and Dissipation.
