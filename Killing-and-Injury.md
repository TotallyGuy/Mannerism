## Killing and Injury

When intention is set to injure or kill, or a GM's test complication is to injure, a wound is generated by the margin of success.  A confrontation "win" result is considered to have a margin of success of 5 or whatever level of injury is given by the intention. A GM Test "win" result is the same as the "+2" result. 

The injured party marks one wound track's boxes with the number given by the margin. 

#### **Injury Table**

|Margin of Success |Wound |Effect |Recovery Difficulty |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
|1 | Superficial effect | No penalty, it just hurts. |1 |
|2 | Minor effect |If you get a “Win” result in a Conflict, instead treat this as a “+2” result. Opponent’s “Lose” treated as “+0, Partial”. |2 |
|3 | Serious effect |Your Skills and Spells all suffer -1. Those reduced to less than 0 cannot be used until recovered. |3 |
|4 | Traumatic effect |Your Manners all suffer -1. Any Manner reduced to -1 cannot be used. If any Manner is reduced to -2 you die instantly. |4 |
|5+ | Mortal wound |You can undertake one final Conflict within the current scene with no other penalties, but you die afterwards. |5 |

Wound effects are cumulative as more wound tracks are filled.

You may upgrade a wound to a mortal wound at will. 

#### **Recovery**

During your downtime you may attempt to recover from your wounds, or an ally may try to treat you. The Intention will be for recovery, but the Task is up to the player and verified by the GM. The difficulty is given by the most severe effect you are suffering.

Success recovers you from the most severe effect of each of your wound tracks.

Failure recovers you from the least severe effect of each of your wound tracks and involves the GM’s complication.

You may only attempt to recover from, or be treated for, injuries once for each instance of downtime.

Following a Mortal Wound, only if you can immediately enter downtime will you have an opportunity to be treated for it. To survive, this must succeed.

#### **Armour**

A piece of armour's quality is rated from 1 to 5 and protects one wound track. Mark the wound track with a shield symbol in the box that matches the quality. For example quality 4 marks the Traumatic effect level.

When you are hit and choose an armoured wound track deduct 1 from the number of boxes you mark and mark the shielded symbol last.

Wearing armour lowers your potential to cast Spells. A spell's maximum rating (4) is reduced by the rating of the highest quality armour piece you wear.
