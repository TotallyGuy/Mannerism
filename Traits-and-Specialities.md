## Traits and Specialities

Traits and Specialities can be used in combination with one another. When both a trait and a speciality are applicable, do not add the Manner and Skill together, instead use the higher number twice and ignore the lower one.

When you advance a Manner or Skill associated with a Trait or Speciality you get to mark the Trait or Speciality for advancement.

When all your Traits are marked for advancement, you get a new Trait or get to change an existing one. Then erase the advancement markers.

When all your Specialities are marked for advancement, you get a new Speciality or get to change an existing one. Erase the advancement markers.

The group discusses how the character has been played. Together decide on the descriptor and put it against a suitable ability. Traits and Specialities can also be applied to magical abilities from the next section.

If a Manner, Skill or Spell is rated 4 then keep the associated Trait or Speciality advancement box marked.
