## Traits and Specialities

Traits are descriptors tied to Manners.
Specialities are a specific use of a Skill or Spell.

In the event of a tied conflict check the used Manner, Skill or Spell for an appropriate Trait or Speciality. The party with the most applicable descriptors may break the tie in their favour.

Traits and Specialities can be used in combination with one another. When both a trait and a speciality are applicable, do not add the Manner and Skill together, instead use the higher number twice and ignore the lower one.

When you advance a Manner or Skill associated with a Trait or Speciality you get to mark the Trait or Speciality for advancement.

When all your Traits are marked for advancement, you get a new Trait or get to change an existing one. Then erase the advancement markers.

When all your Specialities are marked for advancement, you get a new Speciality or get to change an existing one. Erase the advancement markers.

The group discusses how the character has been played. Together decide on the descriptor and put it against a suitable ability. 

Specialities can be used to accomplish things outside of the normal scope of the ability. Agility (Martial Arts) would allow an unarmed character opportunity to fight someone unarmed when usually the GM would say that the task and intention do noo match up. Divination (Speaking with Dead) would allow a character to speak with someone on the other side. 

If a Manner, Skill or Spell is rated 4 then keep the associated Trait or Speciality advancement box marked.
